Okay, so um what I guess what I'm trying to say is that this whole idea kind of came from like noticing how after meetings I never really knew if I explained myself properly. You know, I'd walk out thinking it was fine, but then later I'd replay it and realize I paused a lot, repeated myself, or sort of lost the point halfway through a sentence. And uh that's frustrating because it feels like you're improving but you're actually just guessing. So basically the goal here is to like capture those moments how often I say um or like, how long I pause when my pace speeds up for no reason, and put numbers on it. I think once you see that data it's harder to lie to yourself which is uncomfortable but probably necessary. And yeah, I'm not trying to sound perfect. I'm just trying to sound clearer over time.
