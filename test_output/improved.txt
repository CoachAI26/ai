What I'm trying to say is that this idea came from realizing I often leave meetings unsure if I explained myself well. I'd think it went fine, but later I'd replay it and notice I paused a lot, repeated myself, or lost track of my point. It's frustrating because it feels like you're improving, but you're really just guessing. The goal is to capture those moments—how often I pause, how long those pauses are, and when my pace speeds up unexpectedly—and quantify them. Once you see that data, it's harder to deceive yourself, which is uncomfortable but necessary. I'm not aiming for perfection, just clarity over time.
